# Create a simple REST API 

### The Brief:

Create a working RESTful API, ideally using a .NET based framework.  However, if you're more familiar with another language / framework, feel free to use that instead.

This task shouldn't take you more than a morning but if you find yourself running out of time, please describe the features you would have liked to add in the readme.

The API will allow a consumer to save, update and get transactions. Auth is considered out of scope for this test.

A transaction has the following properties:
* TransactionId
* TransactionDate
* Description 
* TransactionAmount
* CreatedDate 
* ModifiedDate 
* CurrencyCode 
* Merchant 

>  **Merchant and Description are optional**

What you can use is pretty open (use whatever frameworks you are comfortable with) but it has to meet the following criteria (order of importance).

1. **Your solution must compile and run first time** - we shouldn't have to add any additional config etc (feel to add any instructions in the readme).

2. The solution should be as simple as possible. More weight is given to the solution with the **least complexity**. 

3. Transactions must be stored - you can use anything you like to achieve this, but consider the importance 1 & 2 in your solution. 

4. The API must have an endpoint to create a new transaction.

5. The API must have an endpoint to update a transaction.

6.  The API must have an endpoint to delete a transaction.

7. The API must have an endpoint to get a transaction.

8. The API must have an endpoint to get a list of all transactions.

9. Your solution should contain tests, again how you do this is left up to you - unit, integration, acceptance etc. You can add more than one test project to demonstrate different test techniques for example integration / unit.

##### How to Submit your test to us:
 - Create a public repo using GitHub, BitBucket etc.
 - Code your solution.
 - Add a readme with the following information:
   - a short description of your API what have used, debugging instructions (*don't forget point 1*) any comments you wish to add
   - The time you spent on the project.
   - If you ran out of time, but would have liked to implemented certain features, tell us why.
 - When you're happy with your solution, send us the link.


GOOD LUCK :smile:
